CPU speed checker

`./speed fast` to get a quick reading (may be horribly inaccurate due to frequency scaling)

`./speed` to get a fairly reliable reading (takes longer)

`./speed slow` to get a really good speed reading (takes much longer)

Uses RDTSC and sched_setaffinity so should work on any CPU type that supports RDTSC (i.e. both AMD and Intel)

Automatic overclocking (Turbo Boost / Turbo Core) will screw things up a bit.
